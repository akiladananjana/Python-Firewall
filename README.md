Python based Packet Filtering Firewall

# What is Packet Filtering Firewall?
Packet filtering firewall is a network security technique that is used to control data flow to and from a network. It is a security mechanism that allows the movement of packets across the network and controls their flow on the basis of a set of rules, protocols, IP addresses, and ports.

# How this Firewall works?
In this simple firewall, I added 4 interfaces and these interfaces are running on threads for receive the traffic simultaneously.

# Top Features
